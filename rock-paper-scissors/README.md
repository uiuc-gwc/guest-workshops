# Rock Paper Scissors

Time: 1 hour <br>
Ages: 8th - 12th grade (skews younger)


This is a place to add in workshops for when we (GWC) are asked to do a workshop for another organization. The one in here was for the beginner track for ChicTech. 

The slide deck in here has some introductory information on Python. It also briefly goes over what `while` loops and  `if` / `elif` / `else` statements are. Then, it goes on to the demo which includes a replit link. The replit link would need to be updated for future presentations. 

The code that we would use for the replit is included in `rps.py`. To create the one that would be forked, we can take out pieces of the logic so that the students can complete it.
